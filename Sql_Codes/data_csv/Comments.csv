Sebastian Ullrich1,63,"@EpsilonVector: for the purpose of this discussion, it's probably not worth being too strict on the definition of ""touch typing"": if you can accomplish the same result (remembering the position of keys in order to type without consciously hunting for them, and managing to hit them fast enough to avoid breaking flow) without relying on the ""official"" finger positions, then you've effectively developed your own, personal touch-typing system. You may think that's just common sense, but... I've seen people with years of experience still struggling, slowly, to find the right keys while typing."
max1,92,"@Shog9 Now that I think about it, I do touch type SOME of the punctuations (namely ,.; and sometimes '), but generally I have an aversion to the rest of the keys because of all the strain it causes the pinky. What fingers do you use for the punctuations?"

Jeff Foster1,113,"It's consistent with the rest of the language, so maybe your gripe is about the syntax of C declarators in general?  Do you prefer the syntax used in [Go](http://golang.org/doc/go_lang_faq.html#declarations_backwards)?"

Avalanchis1,92,"Consistent in what way? Usually it goes: type varname; And when we create a new composite type, like a struct, first comes the declaration, maybe with a typedef, and then we create a variable of that type. When we declare a function pointer, it's int (*foo)(int arg1, int arg2), which is then used as the type of an argument passed to a function: void newFoo(int (*foo)(int arg1, int art2)).... and as a variable: foo=a_compatible_func;
I think that a function declaration first, and then a var declaration next would be more consistent, like so: 
typedef int (*foo)(int, int) MyFoo;
MyFoo myfoo;"
aaronasterling1,90,"@finnw I've never seen a language where you *had* to say `in` for `in` arguments either, I'm just talking about them. Also, in my opinion, _nothing_ can excuse an in/out argument, and making them explicit does not relieve the pain. There should be no reason to have to initialize a local variable with a value helpful to the function, and have this same variable then suddenly contain whatever the function decided to put there. These two should be distinct. Always."

The best example I can think of is Berkeley socket's `accept` function: it needs a `socklen_t*` argument that, on input, must contain the size of the `struct sockaddr*` you've passed; and on output, will contain the number of bytes that have been written to it.

marc hoffman1,136,"+1 for ""take breaks and walk around""  I find myself doing this 2-5 times a day just even a circle around the office to get the blood flowing again is a great refresher."
jamesh1,136,"Although I do not do pushups in the office, I will from time to time stretch a bit which helps equally well.  During my undergrad I remember many nights I would stop in the fitness center for a quick wake up."
Sebastian Negraszus1,136,"""Why should you fight your own body"" 2 reasons come to my mind as of recent, undergrad/graduate exams/projects do not wait for sleep and neither do bosses."
Dan Cirnat1,136,"Answer: ""Your supervisor"""
Gambrinus1,34,"@Chris, I'm trying to say that a short nap (20 minutes or so) is not what you can't afford.  Of course, it doesn't work well when it's 30 hours until exam, and you just don't have time to sleep.  But if you face tiredness on a regular basis, I can't think of anything better."
Darren1,66,"@Lorenzo Games already stress computers enough, so the performance hit is important. However, I'm not sure how much the performance impact would be if all the VM does is wrap native calls"
CesarGon1,66,"I can partially understand not frequently deploying to production, but not deploying to test. Test should be for, well, testing, and therefor requires lots of deployments."
Atomix1,11,"@TheLQ: the point is that games already don't have to deal with ""low level stuff"" as there's always some middleware (DirectX, Open GL and so on). Of course they are computationally intensive, but using a middleware is already a performance hit. It would just be a managed (and jitted) middleware."
soody1,61,"If the OS takes care of the JITting, you end up with managed code that runs more or less as fast as ""native"" code. Remember, if you _must_ have assembly-like control over the program, you can always use program directly in byte-code."
Mark Harrison1,25,"If phrased as ""What's your biggest weakness?"", the correct answer is ""Kryptonite""."
avakar1,136,"I agree, if it becomes a regular thing you tear your body (including your brain) down and this results in less then optimal effort."
aufather1,24,I'm leaning towards using the highly caffeinated drinks only for  when I need to pull all night coding sessions.  Don't overeat should also be on your list btw.
Ran Biron1,38,+1 for picking the second edition too - so many improvements over the first that its a different book.
rsenna1,145,"It's unfortunate until you write
`if ($x<10) do_something();  and_call_me();`  and then wonder why you never get a call.  I wish C and family would require the braces, to prevent that type of error."
hallidave1,41,"You can generate the beans easily with Eclipse. Just declare your attributes and go under ""Source -> Generate Getters and Setters ..."". Since eclipse is commonly used to program in Java, I don't see how ""Too much code"" and ""So annoying a 3rd party had to come up with a plugin to do this easily"" are a problem."
Abelardo Cecena1,18,@TheLQ: Instead of `private final int` it could have been `int`.
Nick Ace1,11,Does a Kindle count as a single book?
Alex C1,11,"+1 -- I have the Italian translation. After that, I never bought another programming or technical book translated in my language, as the translation was terrible. I had to buy the English edition to actually understand some sentences!"
drrlvn1,147,This answer seems off-topic because it is not about **syntax**.
Martin Kenny1,90,@Jonas then `public static final int` could have been `public static int`?
janmr1,90,"@Lorenzo While I agree that running at maximum privileges is never a good idea, I think running as `root` is much more dangerous than running as `Administrator`. `root` has full power in whatever it tries; `Administrator` is still bound to whatever Windows thinks is right. For instance, you can reformat your hard drive while using it under Linux. Pretty sure Windows will never let you."
Quandary1,136,We had the fourth edition but this is a great book on algorithms!
Ahmed Atia1,66,"Once again when code is so verbose that it needs auto generating tools, something is wrong. I'm a NetBeans guy, but it also has the ability to auto generate getters and setters. But Javadoc falls out of syn, it's still verbose, it still clutters javadoc, etc"
Vimal Raj1,18,@zneak: Or how about `public { int counter; double lat; double lng; }` - a public block.
Hagai L1,18,"Alien paradigm? It's closer to math than imperative programming is. Here in Sweden I think that most CS students at university is thaut functional programming first. E.g. we started out with Standard ML, before C, Erlang and Java."
